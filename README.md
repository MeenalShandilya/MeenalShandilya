- 👋 Hi, I’m @MeenalShandilya!
- 👀 I’m interested in cool projects created using Python, Java etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, through WhiteHat Jr, but I'm also looking forward to know more about other coding languages.
- 🎵 I'm also particularly interested in music projects :)
- 🎮 Since I like gaming (I'm not a pro, though), I really appreciate games and other fun projects.
- 📫 If you've come across any such project, you can mail me its link at vandy.shandilya@gmail.com
- 😃 Also, please view my projects and leave a like if you liked them. Thanks!
